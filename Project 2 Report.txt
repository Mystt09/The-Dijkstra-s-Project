* ask chatGPT to explain C++ concepts and how to implement them 

Errors: 

Main.cpp:39:25: error: expected ‘}’ before ‘{’ token
   39 |                         {1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
      |                         ^

It is not recognizing that i do have a { in the beginning.. 


Refreshed terminal, it started to work somehow 


Main.cpp:74:5: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope; did you mean ‘std::cout’?
   74 |     cout << "Odd Vertices: ";
      |     ^~~~
      |     std::cout

* Don’t forget to include the namespace std; 

Vertex.cpp:9:18: error: ‘class Vertex’ has no member named ‘Index’; did you mean ‘index’?
    9 |     return this->Index;
      |                  ^~~~~
      |                  index

Solution: change this->Index to lower case i for Index 

Forgot how to run the code so went to chat gpt 

From chatGPT: 

It did not print anything because it was waiting for input - chatGPT


Run the project with the test case:
